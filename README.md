# CG1111-CELCPresentation

CG1111 Presentation done on smoke detectors. Do note that the code written is not the best way to do things, I just wanted a quick way to get the smoke detector working.
Moreover my smoke detector is not really for detecting smoke, it is more for detection of butane gas or so... Read the data sheet for MQ2 and other MQ detectors...
Some are better suited for detecting a certain gas than the other... My detector just so happen to work...
